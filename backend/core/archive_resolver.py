"""Archive resolver stub.

The MVP spec describes a multi-stage strategy for retrieving archived snapshots
when a reference appears paywalled.  Implementing that entire algorithm would
require external APIs and rate-limiting; for *MVP code completeness* the
present class only exposes the contract so that the scraper can call it and
proceed regardless of paywall status.  A future enhancement can replace the
body of :pymeth:`resolve` without touching call-sites.
